The purpose of this exercise is to continue getting used to working with JSON
objects and creating Ruby Objects from them.

Here, you are expected to read the provided JSON file and created an array of
nested objects. You will have an `Item` object that has attributes for id, type,
name, and ppu. It will have an attribute called `batters` which will be in turn
an array of `Batter` objects which have the attributes of id and type.

`Item` will also have an attribute of toppings which will be an array consisting
of `Topping` objects that have the attributes of id and type.

Bonus: How can you use inheritance here?
